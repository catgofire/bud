# Intro

Let's discover **Bud in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new project**.

Add a file to `src/index.js`

## Install

```shell
yarn add @roots/bud @roots/bud-cli
```

## Build your application

You're ready to run your build:

```shell
yarn bud build
```

## Develop your application

```shell
yarn bud dev
```

Your site starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open `src/index.js` and make some edits: the site **reloads automatically** and display your changes.
